**PO Review**

## Phase Sign-off

> **Permanent, append-only — never pruned.** One line per phase the PO has play-tested
> **clean** on the real running build (its Visual Review gate, e.g. P1-10, passed). This is
> the explicit done-gate: the build loop reads it to know which phase is current — the
> **current phase is the lowest-numbered `phaseN.md` NOT listed here**. A phase is *not*
> advanced just because its code compiles and tests are green; it advances only when it
> appears below. (List empty ⇒ current phase is Phase 1.)

- **Phase 1 — SIGNED OFF 2026-06-30 (owner, larssski).** Played the live deployed build
  (https://kilars.github.io/braa/) at 390×844: licensed Labrador loads (no primitive flash),
  centered + shadow-grounded, idle → sit → clear seated apex → honest apex tell → BRA tap →
  joyful reaction → loop, all P1 stories (P1-0…P1-9) pass, logic is test-first, verify green.
  Accepted **as complete as best as possible**: the two residual gaps are owner-gated polish,
  not core-loop defects, and ship with honest stand-ins — the genuinely-spoken espeak "Bra!"
  (warm human Maren recording drops in under the same cue id, no code change) and the coat
  UV/tangent seam (a licensed-asset re-export, tracked as an open flag). Both remain open
  flags for the owner to close later; neither blocks the core mark. **Phase 2 is now current.**

- **Phase 2 — Visual Review passed 2026-07-01 (PO, father pass).** Played the current HEAD
  (`7a3f12f`) on a 390×844 phone-portrait viewport — both the local licensed bundle (`build/web`,
  the 38 MB pck rebuilt 17:26, after the 066 commit at 17:21) served over http in headless Chromium
  (SwiftShader == the deployed GL Compatibility renderer) **and** the **live Pages site**
  (https://kilars.github.io/braa/). Zero console errors on every run. The prior pass's sole blocker
  — "the roster is owner-gated, there is no second trick" — was a **behavior≠inventory error**: the
  licensed Labrador already held **Ligg** (`Lie_*`) and **Legg deg** (`Lie_belly_*`), and they are now
  wired as real, distinct tricks (065 / 067) behind a live **trick selector** (066), so the phase's
  headline — *more tricks at the Sitt standard* — is genuinely delivered. Verified in my own pixels:
  **P2-1** a top chip row (Sitt · Ligg · Legg deg), tapping a chip repoints the trick, the gold
  highlight + per-trick learned pip follow, live on **both** builds; **P2-2 / P2-3** three visibly
  **distinct** apex poses (Sitt = upright seated chest-high; Ligg = low sphinx lie; Legg deg = flatter
  belly-settle, forelegs sprawled), each reading as its behaviour, each turning to face the camera at a
  PERFECT apex (P2-11), no T-pose / foot-slide / snap, honest apex tell; **P2-4** PERFECT climbs the
  bar → full-**gold mastery latch**, a mistimed tap **erodes** it (bar visibly drops ~40 %→30 % with a
  brief **red setback wash** + the dog's confused beat), floors at 0, no hard-fail; **P2-5** the
  mastered bar (the very latest marks) **persists** across a same-origin reload, per-trick isolated;
  **P2-7** anti-mash lock swallows taps; **P2-8** the dog wanders varied headings on a 0.8–2.0 s
  feinting cadence; **P2-9** the fading cyan approach ring lands on the apex, distinct from the gold
  tell; **P2-10** the garden fills the phone, sun + sky + painterly grass, BRA over the grass, no
  letterbox / cyan seam. Re-checked **Phase 1** on the same build — the Sitt core loop
  (idle → wander → face-camera → seated apex → tell → PERFECT → joyful reaction → loop) is intact, no
  regression. Accepted **as complete as best as possible**: the residuals are owner-gated, not core
  defects, and ship honest — the **expansion** tricks *Gi labb / Rull / Snurr* have **no** clip in the
  licensed asset (manifest-busted; a standing owner flag, and the P2-2 starter set Sitt/Ligg/Legg deg
  *is* complete), and the Phase-1 human "Bra!" voice (Piper stand-in) + coat UV/tangent seam remain
  open flags. None blocks the core mark. **Phase 3 is now current.**

- **Phase 3 — SIGNED OFF 2026-07-04 (owner, larssski).** Dog-breeds phase accepted done at HEAD
  `b2041dc`. The buildable spine shipped and replays clean on the real build: coin economy + drawn
  coin readout, one-active-trick completion menu (learned / available / locked + coins), centered
  camera-facing dog with the scratch feint, late-biased PERFECT window + round BRA button,
  `BreedPersonality` levers, chocolate-Labrador coat variant, the collect → adopt → switch → persist
  roster, the spotlit breed-select showcase (drawn chevrons, training HUD hidden), the textured
  garden, and the joy-beat reaction (no rear-spin / flick). All owner actionable notes (1–7) were
  addressed (tasks 070–079 + 077) and the two showcase bugs are fixed (089 / 090). Accepted
  **as complete as best as possible**: the residual gaps are owner-gated, not core-loop defects, and
  ship with honest stand-ins — a genuinely **distinct second breed model** (P3-D1/D2/D4) and a
  camera-facing **signature clip** (P3-2), the warm human "Bra!" voice, and the live-telemetry
  `POSTHOG_TOKEN` secret. All remain open flags for the owner to close later; none blocks the core
  loop. **Phase 5 is now current** (spec numbering skips 4/7 — difficulty moved to Phase 9).

- **Phase 5 — SIGNED OFF 2026-07-04 (owner, larssski).** Marker-words phase accepted done. The
  buildable stories shipped and verify green (tasks 091–095): unlockable stronger Norwegian marker
  words with per-word timing window + cooldown, the menu showing each word's cost/rest **before**
  loading, the fired word popping up from the BRA button on a successful mark, and a legible
  resting/cooldown readout. Accepted **as complete as best as possible** — the only residual is
  owner-gated: the warm **human "Bra!" / Maren voice** recordings for the alternative words ship
  with honest synthetic stand-ins under the same cue ids (open flag), swappable with no code change.
  **Phase 6 is now current.**

- **Phase 6 — Visual Review passed 2026-07-05 (PO, father pass).** Design-system + training-page
  ambiance phase accepted done at HEAD `a3750fe`. Played the fresh local licensed bundle (`build/web`,
  rebuilt at this HEAD via `verify.sh`, gate green) served over http and driven in headless Chromium at
  390×844 — SwiftShader == the deployed GL Compatibility renderer. **Zero console errors on every run**
  (idle ×3, a 30-frame `?bra_autotap=1` mark burst, the completion menu on mastery). The training page
  now reads as the goal (`assets/goal-training-screen.png`): a clean rounded HUD (white **"Triks"** pill
  with the drawn 3-bar menu glyph + **coin** pill, slate **"Sitt"** label, learned bar with `%`), the
  licensed dog **centered and grounded on green grass**, a **slim winding tan path** that passes to the
  **right** of the dog and recedes to a small **cottage** (cream walls, blue door/window, gable roof)
  top-right, a **white picket fence** across the mid-ground with a gate gap, **gold coins** framing the
  dog, a grounding shadow, green bushes, and a big rounded **BLUE BRA** button anchored at the bottom —
  all in the DS palette (sky/grass/BLUE, GOLD reserved to the coin). The completion menu is a light DS
  **paper card** (slate "Tricks" heading, pale-pill trick/breed/marker-word rows, blue accents,
  Norwegian actions). The three round-2 garden directives from the `6096a41` pass are all **fixed and
  verified in my own pixels**: (1) the **path** no longer over-corrects into a dirt wedge — the dog sits
  on green grass and the path is a slim ribbon to the side; (2) the **coins** read as real gold — an
  in-world gold-pixel scan (excluding the HUD pill) counts **9146** coin-gold pixels framing the dog on
  both sides (was **zero** the prior pass), and a 3× zoom shows actual gold discs; (3) the **house**
  reads as a cozy cottage, not a blown-out tower. Re-checked the earlier signed-off phases on the same
  build — **no regression**: **Phase 1** the Sitt core loop (idle → wander → face-camera → seated apex →
  cyan approach ring → mark → joyful reaction → loop) replays clean across the burst; **Phase 2** the
  three-trick roster (Sitt learned / Ligg / Legg deg available) + learned bar render; **Phase 3** the
  coin economy + breeds (Labrador active / Chocolate locked 30) render; **Phase 5** the marker words
  (Bra! active / Dyktig! switch / Flink! / Super! / Kjempebra! locked) render — all intact in the
  completion menu. Accepted **as complete as best as possible**: Phase 6's own stories are fully
  buildable and all delivered; the only residuals are the same long-standing **owner-gated** flags
  carried from earlier phases (the warm human "Bra!" / Maren voice, the coat UV/tangent re-export),
  which ship with honest stand-ins and don't touch the design-system work. **Phase 8 (kennel) is now
  current.**

- **Phase 8 — Visual Review passed 2026-07-05 (PO, father pass).** Kennel browse-and-adopt roster
  accepted done at HEAD `0ff7902`. Played on the **live deployed Pages site**
  (https://kilars.github.io/braa/) at 390×844 in headless Chromium — the only build that renders the
  **licensed Labrador** (live boot log confirms `dog loaded: res://assets/models/dog_licensed.glb …
  dog can Sitt`); the deployed pck refreshed at 10:06 GMT to this HEAD, so item 1 below could be
  judged on the real rig exactly as Phases 1/2 were. **Zero relevant console errors; browse-grid →
  inspect-modal driven with real canvas taps.** The prior pass's sole blocker is **fixed and confirmed
  in my own pixels on the licensed build:** Bella-the-Labrador now renders as her **warm cream/golden
  training coat** on her blue owned-rarity band — no longer a blue-grey dog
  (`.screenshots/LIVE117-kennel-grid.png`, top-left cell); the 117 `KennelDog.portrait_tint()` decouples
  the coat modulate from the rarity `band_tint`, so the rarity band stays coloured while every dog reads
  a plausible coat (Bella cream, Nova grey, Balder/Sniff brown, Sol golden, Pontus grey, Lykke brown,
  Trulte grey-tan). The minor fold-in also landed: in Bella's modal the «Bella» title now sits on a
  **bottom nameplate clear of the dog's face** (`.screenshots/LIVE117-bella-modal.png`), which also shows
  the warm blurb, 4 data rows (Læreevne/Energi/Mot/Fokus), Raseegenskaper chips (Snill · Tålmodig ·
  Glupen), the «Godbit-radar» Unikt-trekk card, «Kan lære: Sitt · Ligg · Legg deg» (K-8), and the green
  «Trener nå» action for the owned dog. **K-1/K-3** the 8 cells (Bella · Nova · Balder · Sol · Pontus ·
  Lykke · Sniff · Trulte) fill the full 844 px portrait with no dead grey, correct names / breeds /
  prices / owned + «Påskeegg»/«Gratis» tags, under the «Kennelen · Profesjonell fasilitet» header + coin
  chip; **K-2** the inspect modal opens on tap; **K-3/K-4/K-5/K-6/K-7** adopt / affordability-gate /
  switch-to-training / Trulte free-adopt easter egg / persisted roster were driven end-to-end clean in
  the prior passes (`f5b8efb`), and 117 changed only the portrait tint + nameplate, leaving the tap/modal
  path intact. Re-checked the earlier signed-off phases — **no regression**: 117's diff is confined to
  `kennel_dog.gd` + `kennel_screen.gd` (touches no training / menu / economy / marker-word code), and
  closing the kennel restores the Phase-6 training page + Phase-1/2 core mark loop — cream Labrador
  centred facing camera on green grass, tan path, cottage, white picket fence, gold coins, blue BRA
  button (`.screenshots/105-kennel-03-closed.png`). Accepted **as complete as best as possible**: the
  only residuals are the long-standing **owner-gated** flags — distinct per-breed **models** (BUST-068,
  P3-D1/D2/D4) and camera-facing **signature clips** (P3-2), so all 8 breeds are honest tint stand-ins of
  the one licensed rig and share the core Sitt / Ligg / Legg deg trick list (K-8 is honest — a breed only
  offers a trick its rig actually has a clean clip for; no per-breed trick is faked). None blocks the
  kennel experience. **Phase 9 is now current.**

- **Phase 9 — Visual Review passed 2026-07-05 (PO, father pass).** Difficulty phase accepted done at
  HEAD `5331e49`. Played the fresh local licensed bundle (`build/web`, rebuilt at this HEAD via
  `verify.sh`, gate green — Sitt-capable Labrador) served over http and driven in headless Chromium at
  390×844 (SwiftShader == the deployed GL Compatibility renderer). **Zero console errors on every run**
  (fresh training boot, a `?bra_autotap=1` mastery burst, the completion menu on a normal dog and on a
  special dog). The two Improvements that blocked the prior pass are both **fixed and verified in my own
  pixels:** (1) the "Vanskelighet" rows now show the reward/challenge trade inline — Normal baseline / no
  annotation, **Hard «×1.4 mynt · smalere vindu»**, **Expert «×2 mynt · mye smalere vindu»** — same
  dimmed-subtitle treatment as the marker-word rows (Dyktig! «+15% · hviler 2»), derived from the
  `Difficulty` model, so the trade is legible at the point of choice (`.screenshots/PO9-01-normal.png`);
  (2) the special-dog lock now states the **reason** — on Nova (EPIC) the section carries the one-line
  note **«Spesialhunder trener alltid på Hard»** under the Vanskelighet heading, Normal/Expert greyed and
  Hard badged «Låst» (`.screenshots/PO9-03-locked.png`). **P4-1** a real canvas tap flips the global mode
  on a normal dog (Normal → Expert, `window.__bra_difficulty` normal→expert, «Valgt» badge moves) and is
  **swallowed** on a special dog (Nova stays Hard); **P4-2/P4-3/P4-4** the mode scales window radii, tell
  intensity, feint chance, bar erosion **and** the mastery coin payout on top of the breed (effective =
  breed × mode), wired + unit-tested; **P4-5** background grace is armed on the resume notification and
  unit-tested (inert headless). Re-checked the earlier signed-off phases on the same build — **no
  regression**: **Phase 1** the Sitt core loop (autotap mastered Sitt clean, licensed Labrador centred +
  grounded facing camera on green grass, `.screenshots/PO9-04-training.png`); **Phase 2** the three-trick
  roster (Sitt Learned / Ligg / Legg deg Available); **Phase 3** the coin economy + breeds (Labrador
  Active / Chocolate Locked 30, coin chip); **Phase 5** the marker words (Bra! Active / Dyktig! Switch /
  Flink! / Super! / Kjempebra! Locked); **Phase 6** the training page still pixel-matches the goal (tan
  path → cottage, white picket fence, gold coins, blue BRA button, DS paper completion card); **Phase 8**
  the kennel — the only kennel-code change since its sign-off is two **additive** pure lock predicates in
  `kennel_dog.gd` (`locks_difficulty()` / `locked_difficulty_id()`), which don't touch the render / adopt
  / modal path, and closing back to training restores the Phase-6 page. Accepted **as complete as best as
  possible**: Phase 9's own stories are fully buildable and all delivered; the only residuals are the same
  long-standing **owner-gated** flags carried from earlier phases (the warm human "Bra!" / Maren voice, the
  coat UV/tangent re-export, distinct per-breed models), which ship with honest stand-ins and don't touch
  the difficulty work. **Phase 10 (play mode) is now current.**

## Product Owner Review

> Owner play-test notes from driving the **real running game** on a phone-portrait
> viewport (390×844). Each pass replays the **current phase** (the lowest phase not yet in
> Phase Sign-off above), prunes what is now fixed, and lists concrete, buildable

> sign-off.**

### PO Review — 2026-07-07 (PO, father pass 29) — polish-lens pass: verified 163 (breed showcase joins the design system, illegible disabled CTA fixed) landed clean and pruned it; re-played every surface; found ONE remaining wrong-empty-state defect on the freshly-redesigned showcase — its ◀ ▶ cycle chevrons render as fully active pills (and the hint invites their use) in the **single-dog default state** where they are verified no-ops. One buildable directive filed. No sign-off (Phase 10 owner-gated on its empty spec).

Twenty-ninth pass, fresh and stateless under the polish/critique lens. HEAD is `ba74328` (the 163 breed-showcase-DS commit).
Rebuilt the **fresh local licensed bundle** at this HEAD (`nix develop -c bash verify.sh` → gate green, `build/web/index.pck` re-exported), served over http and
driven in headless Chromium at 390×844 with **deviceScaleFactor 3** (SwiftShader == the deployed GL Compatibility renderer). Booted `?bra_autotap=1&bra_coins=120`
to reach the completion menu, the «Raser» section, the **«Vis frem hundene» breed showcase**, and the kennel grid; adopted the 2nd breed (balance 120→90) to reach
the showcase's enabled state and to preview a non-active dog. **Zero console errors** on every run (exit 0). Evidence: this pass's screenshots
(`.screenshots/P26-01-training.png`, `P26-02-menu-full.png`, `P28-01-showcase.png` the single-dog default, `P28b-02-preview-enabled.png` the 2-dog preview,
`P24-03-kennel-grid.png`) + zoom crops (`/tmp/p29_ctrl2.png` single-dog control band, `/tmp/p29_enabled.png` 2-dog control band) + sampled pixel colours
(disabled fill `srgb(207,214,221)` = #cfd6dd) + the harness no-op probe (`spotlit after next`/`next2` both stayed `labrador`) + the code I read
(`scripts/breed_showcase_view.gd` in full), against the goal art + DS.

**Verified fixed → pruned:** the pass-28 directive (**breed showcase wholly off the design system — charcoal/gold chrome, non-DS font, ≈1.03:1 disabled «Trener denne» CTA**)
is **resolved** by 163. In my own pixels the showcase now reads as one system with the menu it launches from: the title/name/control bands are DS **INK** @ .72 (not charcoal),
title/name/hint/buttons draw in the DS fonts (Baloo 2 / Nunito), the name pill is bright **paper** with dark ink (no gold), and **no chrome element is gold** (the two discs
by the dog are actual garden coins). Both CTA states clear WCAG AA: the **disabled** active-dog «Trener denne» is now dark **INK** on a muted pale-slate pill (#cfd6dd, sampled
`srgb(207,214,221)`), clearly legible (`/tmp/p29_ctrl2.png`) — the ~1.03:1 gold-on-gold defect is gone; the **enabled** «Tren denne» (previewing the adopted «Brun lab») is the
DS **blue gradient pill** with a crisp white label — the BRA / «Fortsett treningen» palette from 153 (`/tmp/p29_enabled.png`). Pruned from this log.

**Re-verified clean (no new directive):** (a) **training page** (`P26-01-training.png`) still matches the goal — centered facing-camera cream Labrador on green grass
with the cyan approach ring, tan winding path → cream/blue cottage, white picket fence, gold+rose coin scatter (142), opaque «Sitt … %» learned bar (159), «Triks»/
«Kennel»/coin HUD pills, big blue BRA (153). (b) The completion menu (`P26-02-menu-full.png`) reads as one system — «Sitt» «Trener nå» pale-blue active row (152),
«Ligg»/«Legg deg» «Tilgjengelig», «Gi labb» «Låst», «Labrador» «Aktiv» + the «Brun lab» «● Adopter 30» slate-ink+coin-pip price row (162), the outline «Vis frem hundene»/
«Gi tilbakemelding» secondary pills, and the blue-gradient «Fortsett treningen» primary — all Norwegian and AA-legible (154). (c) The **kennel grid** (`P24-03-kennel-grid.png`)
— 8 cells, corner rarity badges + white price chips with the gold coin pip (146/149), names/breeds — is clean and consistent (the full-body framing on this **local CC0** build
is a stand-in artifact; the real hero-bust portraits render on the deployed **licensed** site, verified clean in the Phase-8 sign-off and pass 24/25 after the 160 MSAA fix).
**No structural regression** in the signed-off phases (1/2/3/5/6/8/9).

**Improvements**

- **The breed showcase's ◀ ▶ cycle chevrons render as fully active, tappable pills — and the hint invites their use — in the single-dog default state, where they are
  verified no-ops.** *What I saw:* «Vis frem hundene» is offered from the completion menu regardless of how many dogs you own, and a new player owns exactly **one** dog, so
  its **default / most-common initial state** is a single-dog roster. In that state (`.screenshots/P28-01-showcase.png`, control-band zoom `/tmp/p29_ctrl2.png`) both the left
  ◀ and right ▶ chevrons draw as **normal active white-on-band pills** — pixel-identical to the 2-dog enabled state (`/tmp/p29_enabled.png`) — and the hint under the single
  «Labrador» pip reads **«Bla med pilene eller trykk en hund»** ("scroll with the arrows or tap a dog"), explicitly telling the player to use the arrows. But there is nothing
  to cycle to: I drove a real tap on ▶ twice and the spotlight never moved (`__bra_showcase_spotlit` stayed `labrador` across `next` and `next2`), because the showcase
  spotlights only **owned** breeds and there is just one. *Why it's wrong:* this is a wrong empty-state (the prompt's touch-targets/states criterion — "missing or wrong …
  empty … states"): two prominent controls are presented as active and a hint actively instructs the player to use them, yet they do nothing — the single-dog showcase
  becomes a mild dead-end (the only working action is «Tilbake», since «Trener denne» is also correctly disabled for the already-active dog). Dead controls that look live
  read as a bug, and undercut the polish 163 just brought to this surface. *What "good" looks like:* make the chevron state honest — when the owned roster has **≤ 1** breed,
  **disable** the ◀ ▶ chevrons (grey/muted, e.g. the same muted-pill treatment as the disabled «Trener denne», ≥4.5:1) or **hide** them, and drop/adjust the hint so it does
  not instruct a no-op (e.g. «Trykk en hund» only, or a "adopter flere for å bla"-style single-dog line). With **2+** owned dogs the chevrons must stay fully active and cycle
  exactly as they do today. Verify in-pixel: a single-dog showcase shows no active-looking dead chevrons and no "use the arrows" instruction, and a 2-dog showcase still
  cycles ◀ ▶ between the owned breeds.

**No sign-off.** Phases 1/2/3/5/6/8/9 remain signed with no regression. Phase 10 (`phase10.md`) is still **empty/deferred** — owner-gated (no spec ⇒
cannot Visual-Review and cannot be given buildable stories without inventing scope), so it can neither be signed off nor given directives. The standing
asset flags (distinct per-breed **models**, camera-facing **signature clips**, warm human "Bra!"/Maren voice, coat UV re-export) remain owner-gated.
The build loop turns the directive above into the next task.
